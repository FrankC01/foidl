    Library support for IO channels

    Copyright Frank V. Castellucci
    All Rights Reserved

    The IO capability encapsulates interactions mainly with
    the outside world via channels.

    A channel can be used to interact with:
        Files
        Http(s)
        Strings
        Memory

    How the individual is interacted with is through an
    assoication with some kind of handler
        bytes
        characters
        lines (as strings)

    Opening a channel and it's characteristics determines
    which implemention of a channel is used.
