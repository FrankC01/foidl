; The 'module' statement must be the first in foidl and
; should be the same as the filename

module hello_world

; Main is the executable programs entry point
; Arguments:
;   argv - You can name this anything but it is a list type with
;   arguments from the command line. Eg. ./hello_world Bob

func main[argv]

    ; print! and printnl! are library side-effect functions
    ; Foidl library functions use the '!' to denote
    ; functions with side-effects

    print!: "Hello "

    ; The library 'get' function takes a collection as
    ; argument and, in the case of a list, a index
    ; of the list entity to retrieve. List indexes
    ; are zero '0' based. If the index is out of
    ; range, 'nil' is returned

    print!: get: argv 1
    printnl!: "! Welcome to FOIDL World."
