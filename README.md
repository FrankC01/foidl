# foidl

Frank's Orthogonally Independent Domain Language (`foidl`) is a functional programming language.

Inspirational:
* Immutable data
* First class functions
* Lambda calculus (partial, currying, lambdas)
* Arbitrarily Large Numbers

My own twists:
* Typeless - Everything is Any thing for the most part
* Delimiterless (mostly) - Not for the weak of heart but I like to decide using format style
